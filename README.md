# Code-Refractor-Homework
This homework assignment has the student formatting and editing an already written code. The student should change the following:
    
    Semantics throughout the code to make it more logical.
    Clean up the CSS file so that it is easier to read and understand.
    Add comments to the CSS file to better communicate what the code is doing.
    Not have the edits effect the code's effectives or the look of the webpage.

This homework is used to reflect a real-world experience in a future job. The client has requested that the developer edit the code to make it more accesible and up to date.
This type of work can happen a lot on the job so the student should be prepared for it.
